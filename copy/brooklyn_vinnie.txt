			<p>The smell of fresh spray paint and car exhaust filled the air at the corner of 55<sup>th</sup> and Monarch. A gang called the <i>Skull Krushers</i> had just left their calling card on the <i>Terminators</i> turf. A gang war was on its way, but to Vincent P. Capone it was all part of the charm. It was New York &mdash; the greatest city in the world.</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;Yee&ndash;ha!&rdquo; Vinnie screamed, his head out the window of his beat up 1981 Datsun hatchback, like a dog panting for air. Black smoke trailed the roaring rust machine as it rounded the corner on two wheels. &ldquo;Get the hell out of the way! What do you think this is... a crosswalk?&rdquo; He swerved and narrowly missed an elderly bag lady pushing a shopping cart filled with tin cans.</p>
			
			<p>She coughed on the toxic fumes following Vinnie. He looked back, it was hard to see her inside the opaque cloud, but he saw the gesture she was giving him well enough.</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;Hey, you know what you can do with that finger!&rdquo; Vinnie flipped down the sun visor, a piece of paper fell out on to the floor. &ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; He fumbled his hand in circle on the floor, feeling for the paper. He dipped his head down by the gear shifter for a better look. &ldquo;There you are.&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>Vinnie was suddenly thrust sideways, his head hitting the window hard. He might have been seriously hurt, had he not spent most of his adolescence breaking things with his forehead. The only thing stronger than his skull was the tire iron behind his seat. The one he decided he was going to use to beat the living shit out of whoever had hit him.</p>
			
			<p>His ears were ringing from the crash; he glared over the steering wheel to see Lim Duck Chang, the delivery driver for Han&rsquo;s Korean restaurant. They both knew each other, like Superman and Lex Luthor know each other.
			&ldquo;Lim Fuck, you little shit. I&rsquo;m gonna kick your slanted ass all the way back to Korea!&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;You car hit my car, Capone,&rdquo; Lim slurred, leaving the &ldquo;e&rdquo; silent, &ldquo;you mick son of a bitch, and you gonna pay for it!&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Capon&ndash;e!&rdquo; Vinnie hollered. &ldquo;The &ldquo;e&rdquo; is not silent!&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t stand for anyone, especially a gook, mispronouncing his name. For Christ&rsquo;s sake he wasn&rsquo;t a gangster.</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if the &ldquo;e&rdquo; has three sisters and a dog!&rdquo; Lim hollered back. &ldquo;You still paying for this. Look what you did to my car!&rdquo; He gestured wildly at his crumpled front end and busted radiator, which was erupting with steam like an angry geyser.</p>
			
			<p>Vinnie looked back at the stop sign he had run when his head was down. He knew he was at fault, but he didn&rsquo;t care. This was Brooklyn, around here <i>might</i> makes right. And that tire iron behind his seat was definitely right.</p>
			
			<p>Just then the alarm on his watch went off. Whenever he got a delivery he would set the countdown timer for thirty minutes, and program the alarm to go off when the timer had gotten down to five minutes. He got the idea from the two minute warning rule on Monday Night Football. He threw the tire iron back behind his seat and picked up the giant cardboard pizza of his hood, jamming it back into its slot on the roof. It was bent in the middle, and slumped over pathetically. The lettering, which said <i>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Best Pizza</i>, was crumpled and pushed in.</p>
			
			<p>Vinnie jumped back into his car and instinctively grabbed for the ignition switch. He gave it a turn and it responded with an awful grinding noise, the kind any experienced car owner would recognize. He was trying to start a car that was already running. He just shrugged at his oversight, punched the clutch down hard, and threw the shifter into first gear. As he let out the clutch and applied a <i>lot</i> of gas, the tires squealed and the sound of tearing metal rang out as Vinnie pulled his old Datsun free of Lim Duck Chang&rsquo;s helpless wreck. Sparks flew through the busted passenger window as the two cars abrasively separated. The pulling force almost straightened the concave shape which Vinnie&rsquo;s passenger door had taken after the accident.</p>
			
			<p>Vinnie leaned over and grabbed the piece of paper that was the reason for everything. It had an address on it, it was his delivery. &ldquo;Evergreen Heights, apartment 1002&hellip; no problem,&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>Screeching his twisted Datsun to a stop in front of Evergreen Heights, Vinnie charged in the front doors and through the lobby, heading straight for the elevator. He pressed the <i>up</i> button furiously; hoping it would sense how urgent his situation was and quicken its decent to him.</p>
			
			<p>He glanced around the room, trying to be casual, his foot tapping rapidly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s taking this thing so&mdash;&rdquo; he was caught mid&ndash;sentence by the <i>out of order</i> sign lying on the floor in front of the elevator. &ldquo;Ah, sonofabitch!&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>Vinnie ran for the stairwell, he climbed the first three flights two at a time, but ten years of smoking put an end to that quickly. The next four flights he endured fairly well, mostly out of sheer will power and stubbornness. But the final three were a painful death march. He trudged slowly up each stair, using any extra wind he had to swear at that damn elevator. &ldquo;Lousy, cocksuckin&rsquo; elevators are always out of order on my shift!&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>He weakly pushed open the tenth story stairwell door, and with all the focus of a zombie, crawled down the hallway. His chest was heaving; his breathing was as heavy as his steps. The hallway was dirty, that was no surprise, this was New York, everything was dirty in New York. Between the dirt there was a motif of yellow stains decorating both the walls and the floor.</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;Very chic, just like Paris in the springtime,&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>Vinnie rapped continuously on the door to apartment 1002 until it was ripped open by a fat middle&ndash;aged man with a cigar in his mouth. His furrowed brow and sneer suggested he was annoyed. Vinnie put on his customer smile.</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;Pizza delivery. That&rsquo;ll be fifteen seventy&ndash;five with tax.&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>The man never blinked as he took the cigar out of his mouth &mdash; and blew the smoke in Vinnie&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Your late, it&rsquo;s free.&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Vinnie, coughing and waving the smoke from his face, &ldquo;I would&rsquo;ve been here on time, but I was sideswiped by this goddamn Korean, and then the elevator&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>The man interrupted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. Your late, the pizza&rsquo;s free.&rdquo; He held out a greasy palm. &ldquo;Give me my pizza.&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Vinnie accent was growing stronger, as it always did when he was frustrated.</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, no. What&rsquo;s the matter tubby? Fat stuck in your ears?&rdquo;</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>&ldquo;Let me see if I&rsquo;ve got all this &mdash; One count of assault, one count of theft, namely a bacon and anchovy pizza; one count of assault with a weapon, the afore&ndash;mentioned bacon and anchovy pizza.&rdquo; Detective O&rsquo;Malley flipped the page on his clipboard. &ldquo;And someone named&hellip; ah&hellip; Lim Duck Chang? Yeah, Lim Duck Chang has filed an accident report siting you as the cause. That&rsquo;ll tag on leaving the scene of an accident.&rdquo; He set his clipboard on the table and leaned in close to Vinnie. &ldquo;Is that about it Vinnie? Or should I get a priest in here so you can confess everything?&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;Detective&hellip; Danny. There&rsquo;s a whole &lsquo;nother side to this story, if you&rsquo;ll just leme explain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna hear it Vinnie. This is the third time I&rsquo;ve seenya in here this month. I see you more often than I see my wife!&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;Well Danny, I&rsquo;ve seen your wife and frankly&hellip;&rdquo; Detective O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s burning stare convinced Vinnie not to finish that sentence.</p>
			
			<p>&ldquo;Now you listen and listen good. I didn&rsquo;t bother to call your parole officer because he&rsquo;s still got thirty days left in rehab. But if he weren&rsquo;t still doin&rsquo; the withdrawal shiver he&rsquo;d tellya the same thing I&rsquo;m gonna.&rdquo; He lifted his index finger into the space between their faces. &ldquo;One more screw&ndash;up and your back in the can,&rdquo; he flung his arm at the door, &ldquo;now get outta my sight.&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>Vinnie started towards the door.
			
			<p>&ldquo;And Vinnie, you call me Danny again and I&rsquo;ll personally kick your ass back to jail.&rdquo;</p>
			
			<p>Vinnie turned back and smiled, then blew a kiss at Detective O&rsquo;Malley before slipping out the door.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>The full brilliance of the moons borrowed light fell carelessly to Earth, unobstructed by a cloudless night. In the distance a pair of headlights navigates the winding stretch of road. A raven appears perched on a fence post, it cries echoed by the stillness.</p>
