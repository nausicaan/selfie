			<p>It had been two years since the ground trembled and the sky was ablaze; the heat of nuclear exchange had passed, and the next phase of the holocaust had set in &mdash; Nuclear Winter. Joan was dressed in the best rags she could find. Her traveling companions, Frank and Mike, were just as shabby. Wearing what little they could scavenge together. Joan was a biologist before the war, now she was a mother to two half-wits she barely knew. Frank and Mike were security guards in their former life. They protected other people&rsquo;s money, secretly jealous of them, the <i>well-offs</i>. Now no one was well off, and cash was worthless. Water was worth everything, even dying for.</p>
				
			<p>And that was reason for their union &mdash; water. Specifically water untainted by radiation. There were stories of a utopia, an untouched reserve of fresh water near Salt Lake City. Joan was not one to believe rumour, but their situation was bleak, and death waited for them in this ghost town they once called home. She knew she could not make the trip alone, her IQ, which was probably double that of either Frank or Mike, wouldn&rsquo;t protect her against the dangers she anticipated. Braun, hardiness, that was what she needed, and that was what they offered. They were more than willing to follow her; they seemed lost without someone giving them orders. That didn&rsquo;t mean they didn&rsquo;t ask stupid questions.</p>
				
			<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we just stay here Doc? There&rsquo;s plenty of water right here,&rdquo; pleaded Frank.</p>
				
			<p>She looked at Frank, and for the eighth time answered. &ldquo;Sure, if you don&rsquo;t mind growing a third eye on that thick skull of yours!&rdquo; she moved closer to him, grabbed his collar and pulled his face down to her. &ldquo;This water is so contaminated with radiation I wouldn&rsquo;t even give it to those idiots who pushed the button!&rdquo; She left him hunched over and walked away, twirling once more to face him. &ldquo;And for the last time my name is Joan.&rdquo;</p>
				
			<p>&ldquo;Okay Doc, what&rsquo;s this button you&rsquo;re talking about?&rdquo;</p>
				
			<p>Mike was bringing up the rear, as he passed Frank he slapped him in the back of the head. He wasn&rsquo;t much smarter than Frank, but even he was growing tired of the endless parade of nonsense that spewed from Frank&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over two hundred miles to this place, and I don&rsquo;t want you to make another sound until we get there, you understand?&rdquo;</p>
				
			<p>&ldquo;But Mike&hellip;&rdquo; He began.</p>
				
			<p>&ldquo;Shut up! Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
				
			<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Frank mumbled.</p>
				
			<p>When Mike turned and continued walking, Frank opened his mouth to say something. But before any sound could come out Mike spun back and pointed an accusing finger.</p>
				
			<p>&ldquo;Not a sound!&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Three days later they were well over sixty miles into the journey. It seemed to Joan that Frank and Mike could walk forever, their bulky frames never seeming to tire. Joan, however, was not so sturdy; several times she collapsed from exhaustion. When this would happen, one of the men would carry her, stopping only when they needed rest.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting tired of carrying her Mike; I think it&rsquo;s your turn.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your job to think.&rdquo; A <i>grinchy</i> smile preceded a silk tone. &ldquo;Tell you what, when she wakes up and says that she&rsquo;s alright, then it will be my turn.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Okay, that sounds fair,&rdquo; smiled Frank.</p>
				
			<p>Though Mike&rsquo;s gifts did not include great intelligence, he had a slyness that few could match. He would often get Frank to do the full load of the work. This cycle continued for many days. They would walk, she would get tired, and Frank would carry her. On the seventh day, the cycle stopped.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo; Frank blubbered as his head bobbed in all directions.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Hear what?&rdquo; questioned Mike.</p>
				
			<p>&ldquo;The sound of something walking on the snow.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Frank, look down, those are feet, and they make noise as you walk on the snow. Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
				
			<p>&ldquo;No, not my feet; it was coming from back there, behind us.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I heard it too,&rdquo; said Joan.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;You both are dreaming,&rdquo; Mike said, laughing at their fears.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Joan said, &ldquo;the sound is coming from all around us. Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s circling. I studied this years ago in the North West Territories of Canada.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Studied what?&rdquo; Frank groaned nervously.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;A phenomena of hunting packs; they circle, size up their prey, and then attack.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Attack?!&rdquo; shouted Frank.</p>

			<p>No other words followed, only screams of terror and pain, and sounds of flesh tearing, and bones crushing.</p>
