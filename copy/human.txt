		    <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t arrest you Ben, you didn&rsquo;t kill Gerald,&rdquo; said Frank Stark, interim Sheriff of Small, Nebraska.</p>
			<p>Ben Ford leaned forward in his chair, stretched his elbows onto franks cluttered desk, and cradled his weary head in his hands. &ldquo;I killed him,&rdquo; he spoke low and with conviction, &ldquo;as surely as if I had shot him.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking crazy,&rdquo; Frank grabbed Ben&rsquo;s chair and spun it towards him. &ldquo;Gerald had a heart attack, it wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it? Do you really believe that?&rdquo; he jerked the chair away and stood up, then walked to the window and pulled at the blinds with his long, thick fingers. Through the hole he stared down at the street, it was nearly empty. Old Pete who owned the grocery store was locking up, and Mrs. McFarland was walking Percy, her prized poodle. &ldquo;I wonder if they believe it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Dammit Ben, I don&rsquo;t know what I can say to make this right.&rdquo; A light flickered in his eyes for a moment. &ldquo;What you need is an ear that knows what to listen for.&rdquo; Frank moved to the door and opened it just enough to allow his large head to pass through. He craned his neck and eyeballed a young girl in a blue dress clacking away at an old style typewriter. &ldquo;Debbie, call Doctor Roberts and get her over here.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Ben turned, he had the face of an eight-year-old whose just been told he&rsquo;s having spinach for dinner. &ldquo;Not Moira.&rdquo; He moaned.</p>
			<p>Dr. Moira Roberts, PhD. and clinical psychologist specializing in stress and its effect on job performance, especially as it relates to law enforcement. Born in Sussex, England and schooled at Oxford, her decision to come to America and take a job in a backward Nebraska town has been the source of gossip since the day she arrived three years ago.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I certainly hope this is important Deputy Stark, I was in the middle of a session.&rdquo; Moira said as she dumped her handbag on Debbie&rsquo;s desk. Debbie gave her a stern glance and shared her frustration with Frank by shooting him a similar look.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It is important Doctor Roberts, and its Sheriff now.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Is congratulations appropriate?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Frank ignored that and instead opened the door to his office. He gestured her in and then followed, closing the door behind him. Ben was still staring out the window; he made no effort to acknowledge either Moira or Frank as they entered.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Ben, Doctor Roberts is here, she&rsquo;d like to speak to you about your problem.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;No Frank, you&rsquo;d like her to speak to me. Maybe she can settle me down, right Frank?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Frank opened his mouth, but Moira was quicker. &ldquo;Mr. Ford</p>

			<p>Gerald Brennan was Small&rsquo;s Sheriff for twenty-nine straight years. In that time the most dangerous thing he ever faced was re-election. Most of the town folk would say he was a good man, and a good sheriff. He never came down too hard on the local boys when they got carried away having fun. But he never stood for any flagrant disregard for the law either. All in all he was fair, and everyone respected that.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;You know the rest.&rdquo; He looked at Frank, then turned back to Moira, her eyes static. He hadn&rsquo;t seen her blink in five minutes. &ldquo;Well doc, what do you think?&rdquo; he leaned back in Gerald&rsquo;s old leather chair. &ldquo;What magic do you have for me?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t magic you need, Mr. Ford.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Then what do I need?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Human Divinity.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Is that some kinda shrink lingo?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Ford. Human divinity is the power to forgive. Have you heard the expression to err is human, but to forgive divine?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Everyone has.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Well then consider that in order for us flesh and bone humans to be able to forgive; we need a touch of the divine.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;How do I get it?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid human divinity is an impossible circle. To be able to forgive, you must first forgive.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Think of it this way &mdash; you won&rsquo;t have the power to do it until you do it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Thanks that cleared it up.&rdquo; He said sarcastically.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I sincerely hope you find the power, Mr. Ford, you need it more than most.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Because, you not only have to forgive Laura, you have to forgive yourself.&rdquo;</p>
