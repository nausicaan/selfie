            <p>A series of small waves crashed against the shore, each maintaining the rhythm of the last. The air was humid and warm. Only a slight breeze ruffled the leaves of the hanging palms. It was the dead of night, or at least it would have been were it not for the laughter and music coming from the mansion at the top of the beach.</p>

			<p>Joe Russell, secret agent, emerged silently from the black ocean and crept slowly up the soft sand. He quickly shed his scuba suit in favour of the tuxedo underneath. He didn&rsquo;t happen upon this party by chance, this was just the latest mission in the life of an international super spy.</p>

			<p>The house was French colonial in design with at least thirty rooms. Its girth and style seemed out of place overlooking the white Hawaiian sand. The deed belonged to Baron Heinrich Von Kemp, an international software magnate and humanitarian. This reputation had reached most parts of the civilized world, but Russell knew better. The best way to describe the Von Kemp he knew was arch villain and megalomaniac.</p>

			<p>Heinrich Von Kemp was the one that always got away. A notorious recluse, no one &mdash; not even Russell had ever seen his face. He never attended any of the major functions; even the ones designed to honour him. In the agency he had the nickname <i>The Eel</i> because he was so slippery.</p>

			<p>None of that mattered tonight, Russell had a different objective. In fact he had strict orders to avoid contact with <i>The Eel</i>. This order had spawned a furious debate; Russell couldn&rsquo;t believe the company was willing to squander such a golden opportunity to nab Von Kemp. That was one argument he was not destined to win. This was a retrieval mission, no more, no less. Those were the company&rsquo;s orders. If he did his job right no one would even notice he was there.</p>

			<p>With unmatched stealth he navigated the guards patrolling the beach. Russell was licensed to kill, but he saw no need for it here. He vaulted the chain link fence separating the beach from the parking lot and then casually strolled towards the front door, making no attempt to conceal his approach.</p>

			<p>Russell was halted by one of the two guards watching the door.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Can I see your invitation sir?&rdquo; He asked, though it sounded more like an order.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my good man,&rdquo; Russell replied with a smile, and a lame British accent.</p>

			<p>Russell slowly reached inside his pressed tuxedo jacket, moving with due caution. He knew the second guard always kept a hand on his gun. From his breast pocket Russell removed a slip of paper and laid it cheerfully on the outstretched hand of the waiting guard. He studied the finely manicured card for a long moment, but Russell showed no concern, he continued to smile brightly.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Thank you sir, go right in.&rdquo; The first guard finally spoke.</p>

			<p>Russell nodded, walked past the guards and through the large French doors. The inside was just as gauche and overdone as the outside, Russell thought. The intention was painfully obvious, to convince anyone stepping inside that he had wondered into the court of Louis XIV.</p>

			<p><i>Thank God this isn&rsquo;t a costume party!</i> He chuckled to himself.</p>

			As much as he would have loved to continue laughing at the garish designs, he had a job to do.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Russell are you receiving? Have you accomplished objective one?&rdquo; His hidden ear piece erupted. It was the voice of Craig Finley, his trusted partner.</p>

			<p>Russell found a quiet area and responded. &ldquo;Objective one complete, moving on to objective two,&rdquo; Russell paused briefly, a wry grin on his face, &ldquo;and by the way Fin, you invitation worked &mdash; barely.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Objective one, simple put was to gain entrance without dying. Objective two was a tad more complicated. Russell&rsquo;s orders were to break into Von Kemp&rsquo;s office, believed to be somewhere on the third floor, find a mini&ndash;disc containing vital information, and escape with said disc, all without being noticed, captured, or killed.</p>

			<p><i>Easy enough</i>, Russell told himself. His confidence bordered on arrogance. The hardest part would be gaining access to the third floor. The first and second floors were being used for the party, but the third floor was off limits. One need only glance at the entourage of guards posted at the base of the third floor staircase to deduce that. Russell strolled the length of the second floor looking for possible access points. He found none, at least none that wouldn&rsquo;t dirty his very expensive tuxedo. He decided to explore other options first.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Can I be of some help?&rdquo; A woman&rsquo;s voice was suddenly behind him.</p>

			<p>Russell spun around and was momentarily rendered speechless by the breathtakingly beautiful woman smiling at him. He recognized her immediately as Anna Von Kemp, the wife of his archenemy. She was tall and slender with flowing blonde hair and milky skin. He knew her, as the world did, because she was the one who always attended these lavish functions in place of her husband. She accepted his awards, gave his apologies, she was the epitome of social grace, but hardly the kind of woman who approaches strange men, even if they are dashing secret agents.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;You look lost, I was wondering if I could help.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Russell was trained to always be ready for a fight, but he was equally ready to charm a beautiful woman. Then a familiar voice boomed in his ear.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Russell, what the hell are you doing? This is not the time for this.&rdquo; Finley bellowed.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Do you always approach strange men who look lost?&rdquo; Russell smiled playfully, ignoring Finley.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I do when they are lost in my home.&rdquo; She replied, equally as playful.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Hello! Are you listening to me? This is not accomplishing the mission.&rdquo; Finley continued.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Your home?&rdquo; Russell pretended to be surprised. &ldquo;I was under the impression that this was the home of Baron Heinrich Von Kemp.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; she paused, and then curtsied in a manner consistent with the d&eacute;cor as she spoke, &ldquo;Anna Von Kemp at you service.&rdquo; Her golden hair moved as she did, just enough to spark the imagination.</p>

			<p>Russell responded in kind, then with one fluid motion scooped up her hand and kissed it gently.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Then I will endeavor to lose my way more often.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Von Kemp&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo; Russell&rsquo;s ear piece was vibrating madly. &ldquo;Are you trying to give me a heart attack? Get away from her right now before she blows everything!&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Anna was impressed. Russell&rsquo;s charm had worked once again. This could have been just another woman wooed by his magnetic personality, but Russell had a plan.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Until then, I wonder if I could pull you away from your guests long enough for a tour of this magnificent manor.&rdquo; He held out his right arm as any gentlemen would. His easy demeanor and charismatic smile had never failed him.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I would be delighted, Mr. &mdash; I don&rsquo;t believe I got your name.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Avery, Mitchell Avery.&rdquo; He spoke with purposeful drag.</p>

			<p>Anna nodded approvingly and took hold of Russell&rsquo;s waiting arm. <i>She never had a chance</i>, he thought. After a tour of the first two floors that took at least thirty minutes; Russell and Anna returned to where they began, all the while Finley screaming in Russell&rsquo;s ear.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Well it would seem the tour is over.&rdquo; A hint of disappointment came through in her voice, though she hid it well behind an unyielding smile. He knew she was sad to see their time together come to an end. In fact he was counting on it.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen the third floor.&rdquo; He hinted, being less than subtle.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I would love to show it to you, some of my best designs are there, but Heinrich is a very private man, he would not allow it.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be presumptuous,&rdquo; he really did, &ldquo;but as you said, this is your home too. Is it really anyone&rsquo;s place, even you husbands, to allow or disallow you?&rdquo; Russell plucked a pair of martinis from a passing waitress, handing one to Anna. &ldquo;After all, we do live in civilized times, do we not?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;You are right of course. This is <i>my</i> home and my guests are welcome wherever I choose.&rdquo; Anna took his arm again. &ldquo;I believe we have a tour to finish.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Anna hummed softly as she led Russell towards the third floor staircase. The guards offered protest but she dismissed them callously. This new realization had her feeling very empowered. Russell felt sorry for the man who would try to oppress her again. But it would have no bearing on what he knew he must do.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;And this is the master bedroom,&rdquo; she said, it was then he realized he hadn&rsquo;t been listening, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure you have no interest in such things.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Sometimes a woman&rsquo;s signals are hard to read, and sometimes they&rsquo;re not.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I find the bedroom the most interesting room in anyone&rsquo;s home.&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure where he was going with this. &ldquo;It is without pretense and modesty, it can speak volumes.&rdquo; With his arms he suddenly began making grand gestures. &ldquo;It is a canvas for the most intimate desires of the soul.&rdquo; Russell turned slowly to make eye contact with Anna. He was curious to see if she had bought any of that.</p>

			<p>She did.</p>

			<p>Russell graciously allowed Anna to take the lead again so he could reach into his right outer pocket unnoticed. He pulled out a small syringe barely the size of a ball point pen, and half the length. Inside was a highly potent tranquilizer, guaranteed to take effect within three seconds, or so he was told. Now was as good a time as any for a field test. While Anna was preoccupied with marble floors and brass fixtures, Russell made his move.</p>

			<p>He approached her quickly from behind, and before she could react he clasped his left hand over her mouth. Without hesitation Russell plunged the small needle concealed in his right hand into her long, white neck. She struggled briefly, about four seconds. Russell would have to include that in his report. He carefully dragged her limp body to the giant four poster bed, placing her within the ridiculously expensive silk sheets. <i>Maybe crime does pay</i>, he thought looking at the rest of the room.</p>

			<p><i>Enough fooling around</i>, he told himself&hellip; or maybe it was Finley.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the third floor, heading for Von Kemp&rsquo;s office now.&rdquo; Russell spoke into the microphone hidden in his collar.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;How will you know which one it is?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Call it a gut feeling.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Anna had only avoided one room on their tour. Russell allowed her to believe he hadn&rsquo;t noticed. With long, quick strides he navigated the distance from Anna&rsquo;s bedroom to Von Kemp&rsquo;s office. The door was locked of course; Russell had expected as much. His trusty lock pick set was already in hand. He went to work immediately; it took him nearly thirteen seconds to defeat the lock, a personal worst. He turned the knob and swung the door open silently.</p>

			<p>It was now time to earn his pay.</p>

			<p>Russell wasted no time admiring the expensive d&eacute;cor; he went straight for the computer. Hidden poorly within the desk was a safe, which he defeated far easier than he had the door. Inside were a pile of money, some negotiable bonds, and a mini&ndash;disc holder. He examined the money bundle, fluttering it with his thumb. The spy business paid well, but not that well.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Unmarked and non&ndash;sequential, it figures.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>He returned the bundle back to its original rest and moved instead for the mini&ndash;disc holder. That was what he had come for. The mission objective was only inches away. He opened the container and checked the contents. There were fifteen discs within each labeled with a seven&ndash;digit code. The same seven&ndash;digit code: 3657446. The only thing distinguishing one disc from another was the number after the code. They were labeled 3657446&ndash;1 through 15.</p>

			<p>Russell never hesitated, he knew the code was just the name <i>Dolphin</i> disguised using the numbers on any standard telephone. It was a simple but effective code. He knew because it their code, <i>the company&rsquo;s</i> &mdash; and those were their discs. More important it was Russell&rsquo;s code name. He was <i>the Dolphin</i>. One of those discs contained every bit of personal information about him, the kind of information that could prove deadly if it was suddenly available to every criminal on the planet.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s the way the company worked. Agents had fifteen discs allocated to them, one real and fourteen decoys. For security purposes all the discs were protected by an encryption code, supposedly unbreakable.
			And the tranquilizer was guaranteed to work in three seconds. Never trust absolutes.</p>

			<p>Only three people in the company knew which disc was real. Even so neither Russell nor the company was prepared to underestimate Von Kemp&rsquo;s resourcefulness. Agents never knew which of their discs were real, but this time an exception had been made. The company needed their best man for this mission and that was Russell. Von Kemp had a mole on the inside. He had been dealt with, and now it was time to clean up the mess.</p>

			<p>Russell shuffled through the discs stopping decisively at 3657446&ndash;10. He inspected it for any signs of tampering. Satisfied that it was authentic he reached into a hidden pocket and retrieved a convincing doppelganger. After a quick switch and a smug smirk he headed for the door.</p>

			<p>Waiting to meet him on the other side of the door were four large men with even larger guns. Russell recognized them as the guards Anna had dismissed earlier. He stopped dead, momentarily stunned, but recovered his composure posthaste.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Thank God you&rsquo;re here, I&rsquo;ve been looking everywhere for the washroom. My hands are filthy.&rdquo;</p>

			<p><i>My hands are filthy</i> &mdash; the code phrase for my covers been blown and I&rsquo;ve been made. That was Finley&rsquo;s cue to panic, but he was silent. Russell couldn&rsquo;t hear anything from his ear piece, which worried him even more.</p>

			<p>The guards motioned him back into the office. Russell complied grudgingly. They lined up four abreast, two on either side of the door, their guns trained on Russell. Through the open door came an impossible vision.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Anna?&rdquo; Russell blurted, truly surprised for the first time in his life.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be late, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he exclaimed, confused. She just kept repeating the same sentence over and over.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be late, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Joe Russell, garbage man, awoke with a start to see the face of his wife Anna hovering over him.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Joe, wake up. You&rsquo;re going to be late for work.&rdquo; She turned back to her side of the bed, finding the spot she wanted quickly. &ldquo;And shut that damn alarm off.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>He blinked several times as he swung his feet out from the bed and onto the worn shag carpet. He stretched and contracted his toes in the pale green fabric. He put a fist down on the alarm, which had been singing for at least ten minutes, but this was the first Russell had noticed of it. With the other hand he relieved an itch, and moaned the appropriate sigh of contentment. He wondered hypnotically to the bathroom where he turned on the cold water facet. He cupped some of the frigid water in his oversized hands and splashed it in his face. It was the same routine every morning. It was what he liked to call <i>shocking himself awake</i>, and it worked. He shook his head violently and growled a loud <i>brrrrrr!</i> After wiping the residual gunk from his eyes he looked longingly at his own reflection.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;What happened to you Joe Russell, when did you become so boring?&rdquo; he whispered, careful not to reawaken Anna. She didn&rsquo;t like that.</p>

			<p>He ran the water again, but this time it was a more comfortable mixture of hot and cold. He grabbed a small canister of shaving cream that lay next to the sink and worked a thick lather into his hands, which he then used to scrub the coarse whiskers that had appeared overnight. He pulled a tired looking razor from behind the mirror, swished the blade in the water and brought it to his face. He began with the mustache, as he usually did, moving next to his throat. In the times he had grown a beard, it was the throat that had bothered him the most. For that reason alone he was glad to remain clean&ndash;shaven, but he let Anna believe that it was because of her dislike of it. He didn&rsquo;t do many things she didn&rsquo;t like, in the end it just wasn&rsquo;t worth the trouble.</p>

			<p>Happy with the fresh&ndash;faced look he now sported, he returned the razor to its familiar rest and moved quietly to the bedroom closet. He preferred to shower after his shift; he saw no point in showering <i>before</i> slinging garbage. The one good thing about being a garbage man (or sanitation engineer as some of his co&ndash;workers insisted on being called) was that there wasn&rsquo;t much getting ready to do in the morning. He didn&rsquo;t have a uniform, just a few pairs of coveralls with a city logo sewn on them. No one cared if his breath was fresh or his hair was combed under his hard hat. He wouldn&rsquo;t even have to shave every morning if he didn&rsquo;t want to, but Anna liked it.</p>

			<p>With do care he slipped into his overalls. It was his most delicate chore every morning; if he pulled the zipper up too quickly it would make a high pitched noise sure to wake Anna. So slowly, tooth by tooth, he dragged the zipper to its final destination. He glanced over at the alarm clock, in large red numbers it shone 3:29. He was a few minutes behind schedule so he hurried downstairs to the kitchen. From the refrigerator he grabbed a brown paper bag marked <i>Joe</i>, he looked at it quickly to make sure he had the right one. There were two other bags marked Kelly and Joe Jr., his children. He was often tempted to take their lunches, because he knew Anna always put special treats in for them. She used to do the same for him, until his physical last October. Now he can&rsquo;t have salty or fatty foods, which left him with a dilemma &mdash; those were his two favorite food groups. His perfectly rounded belly was proof positive of that.</p>

			<p>Russell snagged his car keys from the hall table and silently crept to the attached double garage. He passed by his wife&rsquo;s &lsquo;92 Corolla and went instead for the &lsquo;89 Chevy half ton truck. The orange and white two&ndash;tone body was offset only by the rust, which had claimed nearly a quarter of it. His vehicles were far from the nicest on the block, but he was happy. Twelve years ago when he signed the mortgage he knew he was making the choice between nice cars and a nice house, he never regretted that choice. A family can&rsquo;t live in a car.</p>

			<p>Besides, <i>ol&rsquo; Betsy</i> hadn&rsquo;t left him stranded yet. He slipped the key into the ignition and turned it gently, it fired instantly. Russell smiled affectionately, next to Anna this was his girl, the only other one he had ever had eyes for.</p>

			<p>He was happy. His home, his family, it was everything he had ever wanted, and yet the dreams persisted. During the day he lived the life of a forty&ndash;three year old family man, with a home in the suburbs and steady job. But at night he was Joe Russell, secret agent, daredevil and ladies&rsquo; man. It was the excitement he craved, steady and predictable had become benchmarks in his life, and subconsciously he wanted more. They were just dreams, it couldn&rsquo;t hurt to pretend to be more than he was, he thought. So he did, and every night was a new adventure, though never had it ended in such a cliffhanger as last night. It was probably just because he overslept; tonight he would return and end it right, he assured himself.</p>

			<p>As Russell pulled up to the depot, the parking lot was full. Ten minutes before the morning shift and everyone was already there. He had to park at the end of the lot, which was the price for tardiness.</p>
