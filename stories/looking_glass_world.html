            <h1><span class="book-ant">Looking Glass World</span></h1>

            <br>

	        <p>A brief flash of lightning filled the sky with a midday glow just as Father Oleckie closed the churches huge unoiled doors. As he strolled down the lonely isles he tried to remember the last time someone visited his church, but he cannot. He was never accepted, even as a boy; his friends would laugh at him, and when he was six his parents deserted him. Now as a self&ndash;appointed man of the cloth, he lives alone in an abandoned church.</p>

		    <p>Father Oleckie was certain he was the only man left on Earth, who still believed in God or for that matter even knew about God. Father Oleckie did know, however, that the world had not always been so incredibly evil, because he had acquired the last copy of the Bible in existence. From his readings he had learned that about two thousand years ago a group of spirits who were rejected from the gates of heaven regained their mortal bodies and killed Jesus Christ during his crusade to save the world from itself.</p>

		    <p>He opened his book and once again read the final passage.</p>

		    <br>
		    <p><span class= "lucida">Almighty God himself has come down to battle these evil spirits. But alas the very same magical cage in which he once used to hold the evil spirits has caught him. I cannot believe my eyes; they are sending him to the depths of&hellip;</span></p>
		    <br>

		    <p>An inkblot blocked the final word.</p>

		    <p>Father Oleckie thought to himself&hellip; What if these spirits killed this poor man before he had a chance to finish his passage? What if the real God was still in this cage locked up for eternity in the depths of&hellip; <i>what?</i> And again he asked himself the question&hellip; am I the only good soul left on Earth?</p>

		    <p>Indeed he was not, there was another; her name was Jennifer Farquason, a former exorcist who now resided unwillingly in an insane asylum. She was placed there when the newly crowned mayor of Stygian found out about her preaching to the public.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I can sense the truth, and the truth is the world is in chaos. This is the fault of the rulers above, they are evil!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>Jennifer would often preach these feelings to an uninterested public. Even though most of the town just ignored her, one person, a mayoral hopeful of Stygian was very concerned that her ridiculous views might gain support and threaten his reign. As soon as he became mayor his first act was to bribe the doctor into signing a certificate of insanity. Even after being ridiculed, ignored, and finally locked up, she still retained all her beliefs.</p>

		    <br>

		    <p>Meanwhile, deep in the depths of hell, Lewis Cyfer, still in his cell after almost two thousand years, was on the brink of losing all hope of ever escaping the prison which he himself had built to conceal his enemies. Just as the very hope in which he had created was to be lost forever, he heard a plea.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Almighty God, in all your glory, how could you let the world come to this?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>It was the first call he had heard in over eighteen hundred years, and it renewed his hope that there was someone left of earth who could help him escape from this cage which limited his awesome powers to mere magic tricks.</p>
		    <p><i>&ldquo;Magic tricks!!&rdquo;</i> Lewis roared.</p>

		    <p>He knew now how he was to free himself; he would pay one of the many demons of hell to deliver a message to the man, since everyone in hell has his price. Lewis pulled four gold coins out of his ear and called out to the little monsters. One appeared. He spoke in a rough tone.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;What do you want of me&hellip; fool?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I will give you 4 gold coins if you deliver a message for me.&rdquo; Lewis answered.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;To whom&hellip; and what is the message?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;The message is in this envelope&hellip; and it is none of your business.&rdquo; He quickly replied. &ldquo;And if you try and open it the envelope will explode, if you try to dispose of it before you reach your destination it will explode, if you do anything other than what you are instructed, it will explode.&rdquo; Lewis warned.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;So give me the paper and the gold.&rdquo; The demon smiled nervously.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Half now and half when you return,&rdquo; declared Lewis.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;So be it&hellip;&rdquo; The demon moaned unwillingly.</p>

		    <p>Lewis described the location of the voice the best he could with his limited perception since he was in the cage.</p>

		    <p>He knew the demon could not be trusted, but when Lewis took into consideration the demons greed, and his considerably low IQ, he knew the envelope would arrive just as planned.</p>

		    <br>

		    <p>Back at the church Father Oleckie was just about to retire for the night when he heard a knock. As he approached the door he heard a rough animal like mumbling, but paid no attention to it, as he was too excited that someone had actually come to his church. Before he could reach the doors they slammed open.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I got tired of waiting.&rdquo; The demon announced.</p>

		    <p>Father Oleckie stood frozen, his mouth would not scream and his legs would not run, no matter how much he tried to do both. As the demon came closer he force out a whisper.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Who are you? What are you?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;That does not matter, but this does, it is worth gold to me.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>The demon waved the envelope at Father Oleckie.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Take it!&rdquo; He shouted impatiently.</p>

		    <p>Father Oleckie, still shaking, reached down and took the envelope from the demons misshapen hands and began to open it.</p>

		    <p>Lewis now glowed with renewed hope. Even though in his cage, he could sense that his package had been delivered. A part of him, however, was still unhappy, so he concentrated on it to find out why. The picture which appeared in his mind was that of Jennifer Farquason&rsquo;s room, where she was struggling to get out of a strait jacket which held her in an ever tightening grip.</p>

		    <p>Lewis could hear her screaming <i>&ldquo;The spirits above are evil! They must be stopped!&rdquo;</i> and he quickly realized that in this present world of hate, trickery, and total dishonesty, she was one of only two people on the entire earth that could help defeat his enemies.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Ah, footsteps&hellip; The demon has returned.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I have done what you asked, so give me my money.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Here is the 2 gold I owe you. How would you like to make 8 more?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Indeed I would, what must I do?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>Lewis went on to explain to the demon that he must break Jennifer out of the insane asylum and bring her back to the church.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I will do it, in fact for 8 gold I would throw stones at Mantor, ruler of the underworld.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Do not lie to me, I can detect an untruth, which is also why you must do exactly as I have asked, or I will know and you will not get your money.&rdquo;</p>

		    <br>

		    <p>It was early morning before the demon reached the asylum. Even the demon, with his limited intelligence, knew he could not simply walk through the front door so he decided on an alternate route, the air duct.
		    Exhausted from another day filled with struggling, Jennifer fell into a coma like sleep and failed to notice the sound of her vent cover being kicked off. The demon wondered if he had finally found the right room, or if this was just another loony who was going to offer him a cup of imaginary tea. He thought to himself <i>this one is asleep, the prisoner said the one I am looking for would most likely be this way, and she may be hard to wake.</i> His small but powerful hands shook her vigorously, but she only moaned with slight consciousness.</p>

		    <p>Now he moaned in a deep and very sour voice. &ldquo;If I must carry her, I will demand 12 gold.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>After a half&ndash;hour of shaking, slapping, and throwing water in her face, the demon realized that he had a full nights run ahead of him and Jennifer would not be joining him for the race home. He would have to carry her. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s for the best; she can probably not run fifty miles in only three hours.&rdquo; The demon thought, pondering his situation.</p>

		    <p>Lifting her on his shoulder, he tried to return the way he came, but to his chagrin the air vent was too small to fit the demon and his cargo. His first thought was to forget her and make good on his own escape, and although self&ndash;preservation was one of his highest priorities, wealth was just a little bit higher. So hoisting Jennifer with the ease that demonstrated the demons inhuman strength, he used that strength to tear the door of its hinges and quietly set it out of his way.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Perfect, I only hope the humans are so easy to get by.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>His eyes squinting, the demon searched the two directions of the hallway for any sign of activity. Seeing none he concluded it was safe to proceed. A quick smile crossed his face as he recalled how similar this was to his everyday life in the caverns of hell. Lewis may be safe from the dangers of hell inside his cage, but the demons are not so lucky. Mantor takes great pleasure in hunting and crushing the life out of the angels in demon form. When cursed to assume the demonic shape, they also inherited the evil spirit that inhabits each demon soul, suppressing whatever goodness exists. He remembers narrowly escaping death many times, and the exhilaration he felt after eluding the lord of the underworld. Each time a little more adrenaline was needed to make sure you lived another day. If caught you are sent to the lowest level of hell to suffer for eternity.</p>

		    <p>Snapping out of his daydream he quickly recapped his situation in his own mind and decided to go down the south hallway towards the kitchen. He had been there earlier while looking for Jennifer. He wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed the door except that he had stopped to steal some food. After all, he hadn&rsquo;t eaten in days.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Maybe I can grab another chicken when I leave; the first one didn&rsquo;t fill me up.&rdquo; The demon said, talking to himself.</p>

		    <br>

		    <p>It was 8:00 A.M.; still the priest had already been awake for an hour, preparing himself for the voyage ahead of him. He was almost done packing when he heard a knock at the door.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Two times in twelve hours, this is a record.&rdquo; As Father Oleckie hurried toward the door he noticed the familiar animal like mumbling. &ldquo;Maybe another message from God,&rdquo; Father Oleckie wondered.
		    Again the demon slammed the doors open.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Are all the demons in hell as impatient as you?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Most wouldn&rsquo;t bother to knock. Are all the humans up here as slow as you?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>Father Oleckie, ignoring that comment, went on to question the demon's presence. &ldquo;What do you want now?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I have something for you.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Something from God?&rdquo; Father Oleckie asked anxiously.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;You could say that&hellip; I guess.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>As the demon brought in the heavily unconscious Jennifer Farquason, Father Oleckie became more confused than he had ever been. &ldquo;This is from God, but why&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;What does he want me to do with her? Is she dangerous? Should I take the straight jacket off of her?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Maybe this will tell you.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>Father Oleckie knew, from past experience, the demons next move, and as a result snatched up the envelope immediately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a good reason for this.&rdquo; Father Oleckie assured himself. &ldquo;By the way, what&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>When Father Oleckie did not hear a response, he turned his attention to where he had seen the demon last and then looked all around the room. &ldquo;Well thanks for all your help, whoever you are.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>After reading the note Father Oleckie began to get worried. He knew she must join him on his voyage, this was not the dilemma &ndash; he was worried because according to the note he had only until midnight tonight. For at exactly 12:00 A.M. it will be two thousand years since Lewis was locked up. It also said that if a spirit were locked up for any longer than two thousand years, a magical seal would completely enclose the cell for eternity.</p>

		    <p>It was another hour before Jennifer awakened. After the introductions and the explanations were finished Father Oleckie and Jennifer started on their quest.</p>

		    <p>The map, which was enclosed in the envelope, was old, making it extremely hard to decide exactly what the instructions meant.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Five paces opposite the setting sun when the moon is full.&rdquo; Read Father Oleckie. &ldquo;How can the moon be full if the sun is setting?&rdquo; remarked Father Oleckie.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;No stupid, that means when the moon is full we take five steps opposite where the sun <i>would be</i> if it were setting.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I knew that!&rdquo; Snapped Father Oleckie. &ldquo;I was just testing you, to see if you were paying attention.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>Father Oleckie became increasingly nervous as the minutes went by, especially now that they had found their way into the <i>Maze of Death</i>, where it was rumored that the mighty Mantor roamed in search of unsuspecting victims.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Are you sure we&rsquo;re going the right way?&rdquo; questioned Father Oleckie.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Of course, and will you stop your teeth from chattering? It&rsquo;s driving me crazy.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I thought you were already crazy. Isn&rsquo;t that why you had the straight jacket on before?&rdquo; asked Father Oleckie satirically.</p>

		    <br>

		    <p>Meanwhile Opus, ruler of what once was heaven, celebrated his fully expected takeover of the universe. As a result of his indulgence in pleasure he failed to notice the humans who had gained entry to his Maze of Death. Mantor, however, was not as careless as his leader. He took full note of this intrusion, and was delighted at the idea of a hunt, for he had not done so in a long time.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Now the hunt begins,&rdquo; smiled Mantor evilly.</p>

		    <br>

		    <p>&ldquo;Do you think the demon was telling the truth about M&ndash;M&ndash;M&ndash;Mantor?&rdquo; Father Oleckie whispered.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Nah, he was just trying to scare us.&rdquo; Jennifer said reassuringly.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Well he sure did a good job of it!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p><i>&lsquo;Now you die&rsquo;</i> thought Mantor as he quickly approached the duet. He became so close that Father Oleckie could feel his heavy breathing on the back of his neck.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Jennifer, how many seven foot demons are there in hell?&rdquo; Father Oleckie wondered nervously.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any seven foot demons in hell, they&rsquo;re lucky if they reach four feet.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Then I suggest we <b>RUN FOR OUR LIVES</b>!!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>They didn&rsquo;t need to look back to know what was chasing them, they knew it was Mantor.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I thought you said he wasn&rsquo;t real?!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I did, but I&rsquo;m a stupid fucker!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>Even though he was a priest he could not help but agree. His fear overpowered all his other emotions, disabling his usual ability for rational thought.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never out run him, we&rsquo;re done for!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Maybe you are, but I&rsquo;m not going to stop running!&rdquo; Jennifer shouted frantically.</p>

		    <p>Mantor continued to smile as the gap between him and his prey became smaller. Just as he was about to pounce, Jennifer and Father Oleckie disappeared.</p>

		    <p>Jennifer and Father Oleckie had not really disappeared; in fact they had fallen into a bottomless pit. It had swallowed them and closed up again faster than even Mantor could pounce. He knew what had happened to them, for he had seen it before and was quite disappointed that one of the mazes traps had gotten them and not him.</p>

		    <br>

		    <p>By this time Father Oleckie was petrified, but still something in him stirred, something he had never felt before. As if possessed he grabbed Jennifer by the wrist and with his free hand reached out to one of the many ledges, which they were passing while in free fall.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a hold of the ledge, don&rsquo;t let go of my hand!&rdquo; Father Oleckie shouted.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let go of your hand for all the money in the world.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>As the struggle went on the minutes seemed to move in fast forward. As soon as they managed to climb onto the ledge Jennifer grabbed Father Oleckie&rsquo;s arm and looked at his watch.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Holy shit! It&rsquo;s nine thirty!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Please, would you mind not saying holy&hellip; nine thirty &mdash; holy shit!&rdquo; Father Oleckie slapped his hand over his mouth. &ldquo;Ulp! Did I say that?&rdquo; Father Oleckie said, questioning his faith.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;You sure did!&rdquo; Jennifer said, trying to keep a straight face.</p>

		    <p>Father Oleckie put his head between his knees and began to mumble. Jennifer could not hear much, but she could hear enough to know that he believed he had let God down.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Come on Pop, cheer up, God has bigger worries right now than your swearing. Now get your ass in gear before it&rsquo;s too late!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>He knew she was right, so he picked himself off the ground and began to follow her. Still he could not help but be disappointed in himself. In his sorrow, however, he did manage to remember something that Jennifer said that bothered him. &ldquo;Never call me Pop. It&rsquo;s <i>Father</i> Oleckie, don&rsquo;t forget that.&rdquo; Father Oleckie snapped.</p>

		    <p>They continued the search for what seemed to be days until finally&hellip;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Look, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Jennifer pointed anxiously.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Father Oleckie shouted.</p>

		    <br>

		    <p>They both ran frantically for the door of the cell and looked in. what they saw amazed and astonished them &mdash; it was God. He was a big, strong looking man, and even though in the cage, he was huge beyond belief. When he turned and saw the duo his glow became stronger than ever.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;You made it!&rdquo; Lewis shouted with sheer delight. &ldquo;You must hurry, time wastes very fast. To free me from this prison you must solve the riddle on the wall.&rdquo; Lewis pleaded.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Riddle, what do you mean? Like <i>what is always coming but never arrives?&rdquo;</i> joked Jennifer.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I do not know. I have never seen the riddle. It is around the corner, and once you step across the corner all communication between us will be impossible. If such communication is attempted the process of myself being sealed forever will begin early.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>As both Jennifer and Father Oleckie went around the corner they took a deep breath and prayed they could solve the riddle. It read:</p>

            <br>

		    <aside class="book-ant">
            <h4>My first is what you&rsquo;re doing now,</h4>
		    <h4>My second is obtained from stone;</h4>
		    <h4>Before my whole you often stand,</h4>
		    <h4>But mostly when you&rsquo;re all alone.</h4>
            </aside>

            <br>

		    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; pondered Father Oleckie.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;<i>My first is what you&rsquo;re doing now.</i> What are we doing now?&rdquo; Jennifer asked in a confused tone.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not doing anything now, just looking at this riddle and trying to solve it so we can save the world.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Wait a minute! Say that again!&rdquo; Jennifer demanded with excitement.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to solve this riddle so we can save the world?&rdquo; repeated Father Oleckie questionably.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;No, before that!&rdquo; She exclaimed.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;What do you mean before that? I didn&rsquo;t say anything before that, only we were looking at it.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Jennifer shouted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing right now &mdash; <i>looking!</i>&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Hey, you might be right. But what about this second verse. <i>My second is obtained from stone. What is obtained from stone?</i>&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;How am I supposed to know? Do I have to figure out everything?&rdquo; snapped Jennifer.</p>

		    <p>As the team pondered the riddle, minutes seemed to take hours. Then as if a light bulb had lit over Jennifer&rsquo;s head, she looked up and spoke. &ldquo;Do you remember back in school, when the teachers whipped you until you learned what they wanted you to?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; remembered Father Oleckie, &ldquo;but what does that have to do with this?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Do you remember in the third grade when they told us glass is made from the melting and hardening of a special kind of quartz called silica? After it hardens it is cut into thin slices and used for mirrors and windows and that kind of stuff.&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;So what are you trying to say?&rdquo; asked Father Oleckie inquisitively.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;You idiot &mdash; <i>glass!</i>&rdquo; She screamed. &ldquo;Glass comes from stone!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;So you mean the second word is glass?&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m saying. The answer to the riddle is <i>looking glass!</i>&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>The ground now shook more fiercely than any earthquake could ever shake it. The door to Lewis&rsquo; cell flung open. Lewis jumped out and took a deep breath.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;<i>Freedom!!</i>&rdquo; Lewis roared with excitement.</p>

		    <p>Meanwhile in the ruins of heaven the party had stopped. Opus prepared himself for what he knew would be the biggest test he could face. Even in his weakened state, Lewis was more powerful than any other spirit in his domain. The challenge would be even greater if the duo could free Jesus.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;There is no time to waste. Opus has learned of my freedom. I will hold off Opus for as long as I can, but my powers will take too long to return. If we are to have any hope of saving the world you must free Jesus so he may join me at my side.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;To find the place where Jesus&rsquo; soul is held you must follow this path, but be warned the way is dangerous. Mantor patrols this area.&rdquo; Lewis warned.</p>

		    <p>Lewis quickly found his way out of the maze. Although he wished he could take his time to recover all his powers, he knew he must hurry as Father Oleckie had informed him that he had but ten minutes to reclaim his rightful place as leader of the universe.</p>

		    <p>Lewis&rsquo; head rose above the clouds as his whole spiritual body grew slowly larger by the second. He knew he could not defeat Opus alone, but with the help of his son Jesus, he knew Opus would never stand a chance. Jesus retained his immortal powers because his prison was not capable of removing unearthly powers.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;That must be it!&rdquo; Shouted Father Oleckie.</p>

		    <p>The team approached a small, glowing red chest covered in velvet with a golden keyhole. Father Oleckie took a lightning fast look at his watch.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Five minutes to twelve!&rdquo; Panicked Father Oleckie.</p>

		    <p>They searched the small room for the key to open the chest, but with no success until Father Oleckie noticed a flaw in the perfectly tailored tiles on the wall of the small room.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Jennifer, look at this, the cement sealant on this one tile is missing,&rdquo; announced Father Oleckie.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; Jennifer asked.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Maybe nothing,&rdquo; replied Father Oleckie, &ldquo;but just maybe&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>Father Oleckie proceeded to push on the loose tile. As he pushed he could see the end of what appeared to be a key, carefully embedded into the top of the tile directly below the loose one.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s here! The key is here!&rdquo; Exclaimed Father Oleckie.</p>

		    <p>He grabbed the key and ran to the chest, he place the key into the lock. Just as he was about to turn it, a deep, dark voice interrupted his actions.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I have found you at last, now you die!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>Both Jennifer and Father Oleckie froze, looked at each other, and swallowed hard. They knew they were trapped, with no way out except through Mantor, who invited such a challenge. Father Oleckie realized that his top priority was the release of Jesus, and nothing could stand in his way. Once again he grabbed the key and with quickness he never knew he had, turned it to the open position.</p>

		    <p>Seeing this, Mantor&rsquo;s nostrils flared with a rage never before seen by mortal man. He charged at Father Oleckie with a force unequaled by any natural or man&ndash;made disaster, and drove Father Oleckie&rsquo;s small body at least five feet into the finely tailored tiles of the room. This show of power rocked the very foundation of the <i>Maze of Hell</i>. Jennifer, after witnessing her friend being brutally murdered, went into shock. But took comfort in the fact that Mantor had been killed when most of the roof collapsed on the mighty beast. She realized if she was to stay alive she must flee the maze before the entire complex crumbled.</p>

		    <br>

		    <p>Meanwhile, in the now darkened sky, two great figures fought fiercely for the crown. Opus prepared to give the final blow, which would rid himself of Lewis forever, when he was interrupted by an ominous figure of a man rising from what was the <i>Maze of Hell</i>. Opus quickly realized it was Jesus who now threatened him. He also knew he was no longer strong enough to defeat both his opponents. <i>However</i>, he decided, <i>all is not lost</i>. He could still deliver the final blow to Lewis, which would satisfy his need for revenge. He knew the population of the Earth would mourn the loss of Lewis, their creator, after Jesus had removed all the evilness he and his evil regime had so joyfully initiated.</p>

		    <p>Opus made a fist and raised his hand for the final blow. Just then Jesus threw a strange looking square at Opus, which made contact in the center of his evil heart. The strange two&ndash;dimensional square immediately engulfed Opus, sending him to another dimension; a dimension where movement is impossible and thought is the only possible proof of your very existence.</p>

		    <p>After finding it much easier to come out of the maze than it was to enter, Jennifer stood in awe as a result of the performance she has just witnessed. But when the show was over she was quick to remember the terrible fate of her one and only friend. She began to sob.</p>

		    <p>Lewis saw the suffering of Jennifer and realized he owed his freedom to her and Father Oleckie. He lifted the mangled body of Father Oleckie from the ruins and spoke.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Because of your magnanimous deed and your willingness to give your life in the name of your lord, I grant thee life!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>Father Oleckie&rsquo;s crippled body became instantly healed, and his eyes weakly opened to see Jennifer leaning over him, still crying.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; whispered Father Oleckie.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alive!&rdquo; Screamed Jennifer.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Well of course I&rsquo;m alive, takes more than a little ol&rsquo; Mantor to stop Father Oleckie.&rdquo; Announces Father Oleckie proudly.</p>

		    <p>After a heartfelt embrace Jennifer and Father Oleckie proceed to travel back to the church where they plan to prepare for all the people which will soon be visiting the church. Both joyfully watched the Earth change back to its former glory. Grass covered desert, rain fell on drought stricken land, and love replaced the evilness, which occupied people&rsquo;s hearts for so many years.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;I wonder what time I should start my sermon?&rdquo; wondered Father Oleckie as he looked at his watch. &ldquo;Oh boy,&rdquo; mumbled Father Oleckie nervously.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;What do you mean <i>oh boy?</i> What could possibly be wrong?&rdquo; inquired Jennifer.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s five after eleven,&rdquo; confessed Father Oleckie.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;WHAT! Five after eleven!&rdquo; Jennifer screamed angrily. &ldquo;We hurried through that maze like a chicken without a head because you can&rsquo;t tell time?!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;Well I&hellip;&rdquo; mumbled Father Oleckie.</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;And on top of that we had a huge monster on out trail the whole time. If we&rsquo;d have known we had an extra hour we could have taken more time, been more careful, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have had to be brought back from the dead!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>&ldquo;It was a simple mistake; anyone could have made it in the heat of the moment. I was nervous!&rdquo;</p>

		    <p>Jennifer turned and walked away, obviously angry with Father Oleckie for mistaking the time; Jennifer kept walking as fast as she could for miles until she finally reached the church. The entire way Father Oleckie babbled explanations in the hope that she would forgive him.</p>
