                <h1>One Final Condition</h1>

                <br>

			    <p>Jasper ran through the dark passageways, seemingly without direction or purpose. But he had a purpose, the only reason a sane person, or a child of eleven, which he was, would ever go into an abandoned coal mine. He was searching for his lost dog. A two&ndash;year&ndash;old beagle named Davy. He named him in honour of Davy Crockett. Who he thought was the <i>coolest guy ever</i>, thanks to his father&rsquo;s bedtime stories.</p>

			    <p>A frantic look and his pocketknife were all he carried with him into the deserted mine. He checked down ever damp, dingy corridor calling &ldquo;Here Davy, come on boy!&rdquo; The only response he got was the echo of barking, and soon even that stopped. He <i>had to</i> find Davy; there was no other choice. If he didn&rsquo;t, he might as well stay away too.</p>

			    <p>Two years ago Jasper begged his father for a dog &mdash; but he refused &mdash; saying Jasper was too young to handle such a responsibility.</p>

			    <p>&ldquo;I promise to feed him and walk him every day,&rdquo; Jasper pleaded, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll brush him and teach him tricks and he&rsquo;ll be the happiest dog in the whole world.&rdquo;</p>

			    <p>Day after day Jasper ambushed his father with that same plea. For several weeks it continued, until his unrelenting spirit was rewarded. Jasper&rsquo;s father was both impressed and exhausted by his son&rsquo;s vigilance. He thought if Jasper could devote the same energy to the dog&rsquo;s care as he had to lobbying for it in the first place, he should make and excellent dog owner. There was only one final condition.</p>

			    <p>&ldquo;This dog is your responsibility; if it runs away you won&rsquo;t get another.&rdquo;</p>

			    <p>That sober reminder echoed in Jasper&rsquo;s mind. He had to find Davy, not because losing him meant never getting another dog, but because he loved him. They were best friends. He had promised to take care of Davy forever. He had given his word as a man and his father had accepted it. At the time he didn&rsquo;t fully understand what that meant, burden and responsibility were just words his father liked to use, but now those words had clear meanings. He could feel their meanings like weights in his stomach.</p>

			    <p>The worst part of it all was he had been warned about the mine. Stories of children disappearing in the endless miles of black catacombs hidden deep within the surface were campfire favorites. These stories seemed silly to Jasper; he never had any intention of going into the mine. The only reason he liked to play near it was because of Davy. The fields surrounding the mine were filled with rabbit holes. Davy loved to chase rabbits, and Jasper loved to watch and cheer him on. <i>What harm could it do?</i> He knew now all too well.</p>

			    <br>

			    <p>It was unusually warm that morning; Jasper knew the rabbits would be out for sure. He grabbed Davy&rsquo;s leash and they headed off. He always used the leash around home, just in case his father was watching.</p>

			    <p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for Davy to catch the scent as they neared the wild grass field just south of the old mine. He untied the leash and Davy was off. Jasper perched himself on a large boulder as he had done a hundred times before; a pair of high&ndash;powered binoculars, which he&rsquo;d <i>borrowed</i> from his father&rsquo;s study, hanging from his neck. With those binoculars he could see everything. Davy was jumping at the rabbits like a kangaroo, but none would venture more than a head from its hole. When he found a rabbit willing to give him a good run, he darted after it. Jasper jumped and cheered as Davy matched every move of the desperate animal. It tried every zig and zag in its escape arsenal but it couldn&rsquo;t shake Davy. Then like a shot it veered off, turning nearly ninety degrees in less than a second. Davy was thrown off, but not for long. Before Jasper could refocus the binoculars, Davy was back on the rabbits heals. The maneuver had gained it a slight lead, which only seemed to strengthen Davy&rsquo;s resolve. Jasper tried to remain fixed on the duo but he was so excited he couldn&rsquo;t hold the binoculars steady. This was the best chase ever, he thought. No rabbit had ever lasted this long.</p>

			    <p>The binoculars bounced up and down as Jasper did the same, though he was completely unaware of it. Then like a crash, the realization of what was happening hit him. He saw where the rabbit was leading Davy &mdash; straight for the mine entrance. A feeling of dread grabbed him, and suddenly he couldn&rsquo;t breathe. Jasper dropped the binoculars; they swung down hitting him in the stomach.</p>

			    <p>&ldquo;No Davy &mdash; stop!&rdquo; He tried to scream, but the binoculars had knocked the wind out of him.</p>

			    <p>Jasper leapt from the boulder and ran, tossing the binoculars away as he sprinted the distance to the mine.</p>

			    <br>

			    <p>&ldquo;Davy, where are you boy?&rdquo; His voice broke, it cracked and pitched; then came the tears, and the runny nose. They came despite his best efforts to hold them back.</p>

			    <p>After two hours in the mine he was tired and scared. Scared both that he would never find Davy and that even if he did; he would never be able to find his way back out of the mine. There was no way to know how far he&rsquo;d traveled. The sun had receded from view over an hour ago. He&rsquo;d been feeling his way along the walls since then. The only sound Jasper could hear, besides his own footsteps and the mad beating of his young heart, was a constant drip from somewhere in the distance. A distance he could never conquer. No matter how far he went, it was always just out of reach.</p>

			    <p>Why couldn&rsquo;t he hear Davy? Why wasn&rsquo;t he barking? He couldn&rsquo;t help but think the worst. The night before he&rsquo;d scolded Davy for barking too much. It was late and he was trying to sleep. He called him a <i>stupid dog</i>, and told him to shut up. Those were regrets Jasper didn&rsquo;t think about, or even have until now, never figuring their time together would end. Now he wasn&rsquo;t so sure. If this were what it meant to be a man, Jasper would just as soon have remained a child a while longer.</p>

			    <p>Jasper stopped moving; at first he didn&rsquo;t even realize it. Exhausted and defeated he leaned against the rough wall and sank slowly to the ground. The cold, the darkness, the despair, it had all beaten him. He was still, the cold wrapped around him like a blanket, his eyes closed slowly.</p>

			    <p>When next he opened his eyes there was light all around him, a brilliant light that hurt his eyes at first. A familiar voice called his name. It was his father.</p>

			    <p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;</p>

			    <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the hospital.&rdquo; His father answered softly.</p>

			    <p>&ldquo;How did I get here?&rdquo;</p>

			    <p>&ldquo;I brought you here.&rdquo; He touched Jasper&rsquo;s cheek, clearing a tear away. &ldquo;Davy came to the house barking his head off. When I went out to see what was wrong he started pulling at my leg. He wouldn&rsquo;t stop until I followed him. He led me to the mine, and to you.&rdquo; He paused for a moment, looked at his shoes, then back at Jasper. &ldquo;Jasper?&rdquo;</p>

			    <p>&ldquo;Yeah dad?&rdquo;</p>

			    <p>&ldquo;Have you seen my binoculars?&rdquo;</p>
